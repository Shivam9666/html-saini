    <h2>Kurukshetra War</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Mahabharata, one of the world's longest epic poems, has captivated generations with its intricate narrative of cosmic struggles and moral dilemmas.
             Set against the backdrop of ancient India, the epic revolves around the conflict between the Pandavas and Kauravas, culminating in the legendary battle of Kurukshetra.
              While considered a revered scripture in Hinduism, the question of whether the Mahabharata is a historical account or a mythological allegory continues to spark scholarly debate.
               Exploring the origins and significance of this epic invites us into the rich tapestry of Indian mythology and cultural heritage.

            Indeed, the Mahabharata, a monumental epic, bears the distinctive designation of "itihas," signifying "thus occurred.
            " This term, along with "Puraan," was meticulously crafted by ancient scholars to delineate between events of antiquity and those more recent.
             The deliberate choice of these words underscores the historical nature attributed to the epic's narrative. 
             Unlike poetic or fictional compositions labeled as "mahakavya" or "katha," the Mahabharata's itihas status emphasizes its portrayal of events deemed to have unfolded in the annals of time, contributing to its enduring significance in both spiritual and historical realms.

    <h2>How Krishna’s angry words reflect his love</h2>
     <p>In the Bhagavad-gita’s sixteenth chapter, as Krishna concludes his description of the ungodly people’s destructive and self-destructive activities, his tone changes from neutral to angry.
         His anger is seen most evidently in the declaration (16.19-20), “I cast them deep into material existence, into demonic species. 
         Transmigrating repeatedly in such species, they don’t attain me, but sink further to darker levels of material existence.” </p>

      <p>This declaration raises a question: is Krishna a vengeful God who casts the faithless into the fires of hell? Not at all.
         He has already declared (05.29) that he is the well-wisher of everyone — and everyone includes ungodly beings. 
         In fact, he cares for everyone so much that he personally accompanies them in their heart as their indwelling guide (13.23, 15.15, 18.61). 
         When he himself goes with the ungodly wherever they go, how can he cast them away? </p>   

         <p>In his Gita commentary, Prabhupada points to this parental corrective mood in Krishna’s statement by his resourceful translation of the Sanskrit word ‘kruran.’ 
            Though the word’s  standard meaning is ‘cruel’, Prabhupada renders it as ‘mischievous’. 
            Though the ungodly may do cruel things, from Krishna’s benevolent parental perspective, they are just being mischievous — and he sternly warns them to protect them from doing bad karma and suffering its terrible consequences. </p>
